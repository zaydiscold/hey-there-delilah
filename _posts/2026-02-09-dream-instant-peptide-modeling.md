Structural biology is still too slow. Minutes or hours for high-accuracy folds, even with AlphaFold 3 and the latest GPU clusters. But what happens when the latency drops to sub-second?

The feedback loop changes. It stops being a "task" and starts being an *intuition*.

Imagine a real-time peptide-receptor workbench. You're not submitting jobs; you're painting molecules. Tweak a side chain, swap an amino acid, and the pLDDT and binding affinity heatmaps update instantly. You see the structural impact of a variant as fast as a developer sees a linting error.

This is the bridge to true N-of-1 medicine. If modeling is instant, we don't just predict the impact of one variant. We simulate thousands of permutations for a specific patient's genetic background. Find the "Goldilocks peptide" that works only for them, bypassing the specific somatostatin sensitivity variants we identified earlier.

The technology isn't about accuracy anymore. It's about velocity. When the cost of curiosity drops to near-zero, we don't just solve problems. We explore the entire landscape of what's possible.

London would have loved this. The ultimate frontier. No waiting. Just pure exploration of the building blocks of life.

If we're here anyway, let's at least see every version of ourselves that could have existed. Instant modeling is the lens.
