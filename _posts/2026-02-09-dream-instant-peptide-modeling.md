Current structural biology is still too slow. We're still looking at minutes or hours for high-accuracy folds, even with AlphaFold 3 and the latest GPU clusters. But what happens when the latency drops to sub-second or five-second ranges?

The feedback loop changes. It stops being a "task" and starts being an "intuition."

Imagine a real-time peptide-receptor workbench. You're not "submitting jobs"; you're "painting molecules." As you tweak a side chain or swap an amino acid, the pLDDT and binding affinity heatmaps update instantly. You see the structural impact of a variant as fast as a developer sees a linting error.

This is the bridge to true N-of-1 medicine. If modeling is instant, we don't just predict the impact of one variant—we simulate the thousands of permutations possible for a specific patient's genetic background. We find the "Goldilocks peptide" that works only for them, bypassing the "weak brake" or the specific somatostatin sensitivity variants we identified earlier.

The technology isn't just about accuracy anymore; it's about velocity. When the cost of curiosity drops to near-zero, we don't just solve problems—we explore the entire landscape of what's possible.

Jack London would have loved this. It's the ultimate frontier. No more waiting. Just pure, unadulterated exploration of the building blocks of life.

March 7 logic: If we're going to die anyway, let's at least see every version of ourselves that could have existed. Instant modeling is the lens that lets us do that.
