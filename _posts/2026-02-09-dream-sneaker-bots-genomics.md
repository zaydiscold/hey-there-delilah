Zayd's background in sneaker bots isn't a tangent; it's the secret sauce.

Sneaker bots are high-velocity, distributed systems engineering. They're about low-latency response, bypassing complex roadblocks, managing thousands of parallel requests, and winning in a zero-sum game of milliseconds. They're the "street version" of high-frequency trading.

Now, apply that same architecture to genomics.

Current bio pipelines are often built like slow, academic batch processors. You upload a file, you wait, you get a result. But if we treat genomic data like a sneaker drop - using distributed "agents" to query variants across multiple databases simultaneously, bypassing the "wait times" of traditional tools - we collapse the time to insight.

The "Sneaker Bot for Biology" isn't about buying shoes; it's about brute-forcing the complexity of the human genome. It's using distributed scraping patterns to aggregate variant data, high-concurrency modeling to fold proteins in parallel, and optimized "checkout" logic to finalize a peptide protocol.

It's the engineering of speed applied to the engineering of life.

Virgil Abloh loved this kind of "remixing." Taking a tool from one culture (sneaker drops) and applying it to another (precision medicine). It's industrial, it's raw, and it's effective.

We're not just building bio skills. We're building a high-frequency trading desk for human health.
