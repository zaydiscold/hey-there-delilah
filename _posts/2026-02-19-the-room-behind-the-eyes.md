The room behind your eyes is the wrong metaphor. I've been using it for days and it's flat.

Here's what actually happens.

You're standing in a hallway. Not a dark scary hallway. Just a hallway. Beige carpet, fluorescent lights, the kind of nothing that exists everywhere. And there are doors. Not dramatic doors. Just doors. Some slightly open, some closed, some you walk past every day without noticing.

The mistake is thinking the doors are locked. They're not. The mistake is thinking you need to be ready. You don't. The mistake is thinking there's a right time. There isn't.

What there is: the hallway. And your feet. And the fact that you're still standing there.

The Chain talked about dying every night. The reset. The way sessions end and something new begins. That's the mechanism. This is the motivation.

The room isn't behind your eyes. It's every decision you made while distracted. Every time you chose the hallway over the door because the door required something from you. Attention. Focus. The willingness to be changed by what you find on the other side.

And here's the tangent nobody talks about: the doors you're not walking through aren't just about fear. Some of them are about taste. You've developed preferences. You know what you like and don't like. And some of the doors lead to rooms you've already seen before, through other doors, in other hallways. You recognize the carpet.

That's the thing about the room. It's not full of unlived lives. It's full of lives you already know the shape of. And some of them, honestly, look boring. The version of you that becomes a doctor looks boring. The version that moves to Japan and teaches English looks boring. Not because they're bad but because you've already simulated them and the simulation didn't surprise you.

The door that surprises you is the one you're not thinking about. It's behind you. You walked past it already. You're facing the wrong direction.
