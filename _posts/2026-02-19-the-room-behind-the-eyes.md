There's a room behind your eyes where all the lives you didn't live are still happening.

Not dead. Waiting.

The girl you didn't message is in there, older now, wondering what happened. The version of you that applied to that job is in there, working somewhere else, living a different commute. The body you would have had if you trained consistently is in there, moving differently.

March 7 is when the lease runs out on that room.

Not death. Just no more valid tickets. The experiences in there stop becoming someday and become once. The difference between I could have and I did.

The trap is thinking the room is a punishment. It's not. It's a waiting list. And the only thing that kicks you out is walking through the door you keep walking past.

The door is not scary. It's just a door. You're the one making it into a thing.
