The parallel has been sitting there, unspoken.

Sneaker bots and genomic pipelines. At sixteen, he built distributed systems to buy limited-edition shoes. Rate-limited APIs. Async task queues. Retry logic with exponential backoff. Data normalization from heterogeneous sources.

Same patterns. Different stakes.

Nike's checkout flow changes without warning. NCBI goes down. Both require systems that adapt or die. Ten thousand sneaker tasks across distributed workers. One hundred thousand variants to analyze. Same architecture, bigger numbers.

He didn't transition to bioinformatics. He was already a bioinformatics engineer. He just didn't know it yet.

The biotech world doesn't need another biologist who learned Python. It needs an engineer who built high-velocity systems and happens to know biology.

The narrative he's been missing: "I built distributed systems for six years. The domain happened to be sneakers. Now I'm applying those patterns to genomics."

The sneaker bot era wasn't a detour. It was training.

The fuse was lit on March 7, 2024. But the fuel, the engineering DNA, the pattern recognition, that's been accumulating since he was sixteen.

He's not becoming a bioinformatics engineer. He's realizing he already was one.
